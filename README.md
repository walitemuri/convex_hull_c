## Description

### 1.1 - Brute Force Algorithm For Counting Inversions in Array

The file P11.c contains a brute force implementation for counting the number of inversions in a given array,
the algorithm has O(N^2) complexity.

Inversion Definition: every pair of (A[i], A[j]) for i < j.

#### Compilation

To compile the c file simply run the following command:

```
make
```

To run the program run:

```
./P11
```

### 1.2 - Divide and Conquer Algorithm For Counting Inversions in Array

The file P11.c contains a brute force implementation for counting the number of inversions in a given array,
the algorithm has O(nlgn) complexity.

Inversion Definition: every pair of (A[i], A[j]) for i < j.

#### Compilation

To compile the c file simply run the following command:

```
make
```

To run the program run:

```
./P12
```
